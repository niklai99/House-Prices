# House Pricing Project (work in progress...)

## Data

The data (found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) has 81 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. 

It is divided into two different datasets: 'train' and 'test'. The first one contain the feature 'SalePrice', while the second one does not.

Data can be found in the 'data' folder.

## Goal

The final goal is to predict the sale price for each house in the test dataset using a model trained using the train dataset.

### Quick tracking of what can be found in the notebook
